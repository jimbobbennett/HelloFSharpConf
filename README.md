# Hello FSharpConf

This is an example F# Xamarin app showing how not to do it.

This uses F# as a drop-in replacement for C#, and uses the MVVM design pattern. Although this works, it doesn't follow functional programming paradigms. Ideally instead you should use a more FP supporting framework like [Elmish.XamarinForms](https://github.com/fsprojects/Elmish.XamarinForms)
